# Memory LCD

The Memory LCD combines matrix technology with a one-bit memory circuit embedded into every pixel, so information is retained once it's written.

The Memory LCD features simple 3-wire Serial I/F connectivity (SI, SCS, SCLK).

Model       | Size  | Resolution | FPS | VDD           | SPI
------------|-------|------------|-----|---------------|-------
LS013B7DH03 | 1.28" | 128×128    | 65  | 3V (3.3V max) | 1.1MHz
LS013B7DH05 | 1.26" | 144×168    | 60  | 3V (3.3V max) | 1.1MHz
LS027B7DH01 | 2.7"  | 400×240    | 20  | 5V (5.5V max) | 2MHz

* LS027B7DH01 can also use 3V power source while recommended value is 5V.

* Interface is all 3V Serial.

# Notice

Due to the capacity limitation of the SPI output buffer, a buffer overflow exception may occur when update the screen with a high pixel count (eg. LS027B7DH01 with Raspberry Pi).

To avoid this problem, you should limit the amount of lines and split one update into multiple updates or enlarge SPI output buffer.
